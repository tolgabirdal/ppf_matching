# Surface Matching using Point Pair Features

As part of Google Summer of Code 2014, this project constitutes my developments of a surface matching module into OpenCV. The general approach is based on [1]. The sample file is included within the main module, and also the test data. The actual module will soon be integrated into OpenCV, hopefully with better samples and documentation.

### Dependencies:

 * [OpenCV](http://opencv.org)
 * [FLANN](http://www.cs.ubc.ca/research/flann/)
